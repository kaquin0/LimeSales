Using python and maplotlib, breaking down a lime company's data of the number of customers that visit their sites and the types of lime they sold to their customers.  
I break down how many customers visit their site on a monthly basis and the types of lime that are sold.  There are three types of lime: "Key", "Persian" and "Blood."
With maplotlib, I plot two line graphs.  The first is the number of visitors per month where you can see surges and fall offs of the number of visitors every months.  
The second graph is breaking down the types of limes sold every month.  I use different color line graphs for each lime sold.  I use "Key" for the color 'Green", "Persian" for the color "Yellow" and "Blood" for the color "Red".
